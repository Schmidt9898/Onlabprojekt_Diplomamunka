Title:
Teams distribute + nested parallel for issues
Clang-12 reordering the kernels makes a large overhead on execution
Clang-14 is a distributive parallel for cause segmentation fault


block = 3d rectangle
thread team = team of thread on the GPU, referenced as Block in Nvidia visual profiler
Nvvp = Nvidia visual profiler
folded pointer = pointer of a 3d array casted from a 1d array; float (* __ restrict data _) [sizey] [sizez] = (float (* __ restrict) [sizey] [sizez]) data;

We want to reorder the kernels in order to improve data locality in 3 dimensions, similar to the way Tile is supposed to work.
In default with collapse (3) the GPU runs 128 thread / thread team, each team gets a 1 * 1 * 128 3d rectangle. With this option, 
there is relatively little data locality in the non-contiguous dimensions
We want to run 4 * 8 * 32 3d rectangle shaped block in one thread team.
We use (#pragma omp target teams distribute collapse (3) thread_limit (1024)) to distribute the blocks between the thread teams and
(#pragma omp parallel for collapse (3) to distribute the between the threads in the thread team.

Clang-12:
    This makes the execution 10 times slower, compare to the flat version.
    In Nvvp the Registers / Thread is high (88) and the Occupancy is low (31.2%) comper to the flat (32 registers).

    also:
        If the size of the 3d space is not static, the folded pointers will cause segmentation fault.

Clang-14:
    The same code caused segmentation fault at runtime if trying to reach any folded pointer.
    In some cases it does not result in segfault, but the results are invalid.

Expected behavior:
Using this method leads to improved execution time and Occupancy.

Actual behavior:
Using this method slows down the execution and causes segmentation fault.

Question:
We noted that that OpenMP launches an extra warp comper to the specified threead limit.

Code: mainslow.c

Compile with:
"clang mainslow.c  -o mainslow -Wall -fopenmp=libomp -O3 -fast -lm -fopenmp-targets=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda -Xopenmp-target -march=sm_70 -gline-tables-only"

If you dont want timer in the code add "-D NO_TIME" parameter.
